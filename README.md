# coct_code_challenge
Code challenge for prospective City of Cape Town Data Science candidates

All Tasks 1, 2, and 5 are contained in Project.ipynb, appropriately labelled.

This code could use more time for improvements, especially adding the validation sections, and a bit more data exploration in the beginning.

The code is more function over form. It could use more time making it more readable. 

Thanks for the opportunity. This project forced me to spend some time understanding and using Git and GitHub. Had been putting that off a long time. Still figuring out what to name a commit for some changes, apologies if some of that isn't clear. Also, i had only worked with Azure. This was a quick crash course into some basic AWS services. I am already imaging how I could incorporate H3 indexing into other projects.

Overall, its a well-structured challenge. I'm glad its within the work context of CoCT, had me thinking a bit more what kind of problems the city could try to solve with data.
